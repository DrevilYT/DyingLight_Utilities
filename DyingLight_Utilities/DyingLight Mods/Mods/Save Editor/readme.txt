This is a simple instruction on how to use the 'Save Editor' for Dying Light.

=====INSTALLATION======

First of all, you should create an 'Editor' folder on your 'C' drive and move the 'Save Editor' files there.

C:\
   Editor\
          editor.exe
          sample.bat
          update.bat

But if you want to store it in some other path, you should do this:
- Replace every mention of 'C:\Editor' to your desired path in 'sample.bat' and 'update.bat'.

=====USAGE======

Drag the save file that you want to edit in the folder with the 'Save Editor'.
(e.g save_coop_2.sav)

!!! IF YOUR SAVE'S FILE NAME IS NOT 'save_coop_0.sav', THEN RENAME IT

----------------

Now we gotta run 'sample.bat' so it gives out the human-readable version of the save in 'json' format.

If 'save_coop_0.sav(edited).json' appears, you can pretty much edit anything you want inside of it with any Text Editor of choice.

(Want to know how to understand the JSON format? Visit this guide - https://attacomsian.com/blog/what-is-json)

----------------

If you've edited everything you want, you can pretty much generate a save file now.

Open 'update.bat' and wait until '(patched)save_coop_0.sav' appears.

File appeared? You can pretty much use it now!

(Make sure you rename the file to something like 'save_coop_0.sav' / 'save_coop_1.sav' / 'save_coop_2.sav' / 'save_coop_3.sav')

=====FINISH======

I hope you enjoyed this pretty quick guide on the 'Save Editor'.
